# Description

The Major Crimes Unit, led by Lt. Daniels, have been wiretapping B&B Enterprises, suspected to be a front for a drug kingpin. Under pressure to produce incriminating evidence or cease surveillance, they need your help. Detectives have gathered intercepted communications in a PCAP file.

Thanks to sources inside the organization, we've managed to map the inner working of the organization. Unfortunately, our informant has been gunned down leaving this chart as our last piece of intel.
